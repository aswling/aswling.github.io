	<p>At the beginning of the semester, the class was divided into separate groups and told to create their own magazine. My group and I were all interested in art and the Internet so we wanted to make <i>FEED</i>, a publication that serves as a physical archive for the rapidly changing digital sphere. Rather than approach the web as the antithesis of print, we intended for <i>FEED</i> to document the velocity and development of online culture, especially since we are part of the generation with firsthand experience of the Internet's rapid evolution.</p>

	<p>The design was divided between Euan Rugg and me, while the magazine content itself was divided among our entire group. In our initial proposal for the project, we looked at Web 1.0 aesthetics and netart. We were interested in complementing the written content with an Internet visual identity that corresponded with the content. For our design proposal, I used HTML/CSS, WordArt, and Windows 2000s patterns to evoke an early-2000s webpage and minimalist typography to mimic a mid-2000s/early-2010s blogpost. It was during this stage we also realized we didn't need to make the magazine in traditional portrait orientation.</p>

	<p>After the proposal, we decided to approach the magazine like a scrolling newsfeed, to evoke the feeling of being able to read without a definite end. Thus, we began designing pages and content to be printed as a Jacob's Ladder where the publication is double-sided and can be bold folded like an accordion and laid out completely flat. Because the magazine was going to be physically "divided" as front side and back side, we decided to split the content so the front side (designed by Euan) would reflect Web 1.0 aesthetics and content related more to early-2000s culture, while the back side (designed by me) would reflect Web 2.0/3.0 aesthetics and content related to present day online culture. The first two page drafts were designed by Euan and the last two page drafts were designed by me.</p>

	<p>We continued making adjustments throughout the term as copy finalized, the Jacob Ladder format was mocked up, and proofs were tested. Euan and I printed and hand-scored to fold into the publications' accordion format. Ultimately, <i>FEED</i> was 145" long with totalled 34 pages of content between the front and back.</p>
	
	<p>The following is our mission statement:</p>
	<blockquote>We at FEED Magazine believe that it is only really possible to shake off some of the influence of the Internet if one is to take a step back for a second and engage with it in a physical way. The space of the virtual, with its near limitless capacity for expansion is transformed partially into this periodical. Because of the speed with which the Internet updates, shifts and morphs both us and itself, one can only engage with it in flux. We must update ourselves to stay current while remaining, at least partially, slightly behind.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>The Internet is always already ahead of us.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>The inaugural issue of FEED has to do with a larger temporality than is usually afforded technological developments in contemporary culture. We take it as our task to trace, in necessarily broad strokes, the development of both the aesthetic and cultural elements of the Internet, from a jumbled World Wide Web into the clean and concise information machine presented to us today.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>An experiment in form and function, FEED hopes to create a considered distance between you and the Internet, leaving you with questions the next time you login to Facebook or engage with any webpage.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>Sincerely,</blockquote>
