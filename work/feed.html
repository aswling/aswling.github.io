		<h1>FEED Magazine</h1>
		<p><i>FEED Magazine</i> was made for Creating a Magazine at NYU in collaboration with Andrea Meyer, Euan Rugg, and Sara Nuta. We were all interested in art and the Internet so we wanted to make a publication that served as a physical archive for the rapidly changing digital sphere. Rather than approach the web as the antithesis of print, we wanted <i>FEED</i> to document the velocity and development of online culture.</p>

		<p>We decided to approach the magazine like a scrolling newsfeed to evoke the feeling of reading without a definite end. We designed the pages to be printed as a Jacob's Ladder that could be both folded like an accordion and laid out completely flat. Because the magazine was double-sided, we split the content so one side reflected Web 1.0 (designed by Euan), and the other side Web 2.0/3.0 (designed by me). We wanted the reader to feel like they were traveling through an Internet time capsule. Ultimately, <i>FEED</i> measured 145 inches with 34 pages of original content.</p>
