		<h1>FEED Magazine</h1>
		<p><i>FEED Magazine</i> was made for Creating a Magazine at NYU in collaboration with Andrea Meyer, Euan Rugg, and Sara Nuta. We were all interested in art and the Internet so we wanted to make a publication that serves as a physical archive for the rapidly changing digital sphere. Rather than approach the web as the antithesis of print, we hoped <i>FEED</i> could document the velocity and development of online culture, especially since we're part of the generation with firsthand experience of the Internet's rapid evolution.</p>

		<h3>Process</h3>
		<p>In our initial proposal for the project, we looked at Web 1.0 aesthetics and netart. We were interested in complementing the written content with an Internet visual identity that corresponded with the content. For our design proposal, I used HTML/CSS, WordArt, and Windows 2000s patterns to evoke an early-2000s webpage and minimalist typography to mimic a mid-2000s/early-2010s blogpost. It was during this stage we also realized we didn't need to make the magazine in traditional portrait orientation.</p>

		<p>After the proposal, we decided to approach the magazine like a scrolling newsfeed, to evoke the feeling of being able to read without a definite end. Thus, we began designing pages and content to be printed as a Jacob's Ladder where the publication is double-sided and can be bold folded like an accordion and laid out completely flat. Because the magazine was going to be physically "divided" as front side and back side, we decided to split the content so the front side (designed by Euan) would reflect Web 1.0 aesthetics and content related more to early-2000s culture, while the back side (designed by me) would reflect Web 2.0/3.0 aesthetics and content related to present day online culture.</p>

		<p>We continued making adjustments throughout the term as copy finalized, the Jacob Ladder format was mocked up, and proofs were tested. We printed and hand-scored to fold into the publications' accordion format. Ultimately, <i>FEED</i> was 145" long with totalled 34 pages of content between the front and back.</p>
