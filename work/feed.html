		<h1>FEED Magazine</h1>
		<p><i>FEED Magazine</i> was made for Creating a Magazine at NYU in collaboration with Andrea Meyer, Euan Rugg, and Sara Nuta. We were all interested in art and the Internet so we wanted to make a publication that serves as a physical archive for the rapidly changing digital sphere. Rather than approach the web as the antithesis of print, we hoped <i>FEED</i> could document the velocity and development of online culture, especially since we're part of the generation with firsthand experience of the Internet's rapid evolution.</p>

		<p>We decided to approach the magazine like a scrolling newsfeed to evoke the feeling of being able to read without a definite end. Thus, we began designing pages and content to be printed as a Jacob's Ladder where the publication is double-sided and can be bold folded like an accordion and laid out completely flat. Because the magazine was going to be physically "divided" with a front side and back side, we split the content so the front side reflected Web 1.0 aesthetics (designed by Euan), while the back side reflected Web 2.0/3.0 aesthetics and content related to present day online culture (designed by me). We wanted the reader to feel like they were traveling through an Internet time capsule.</p>

		<p>We continued making adjustments throughout the term as copy finalized, the Jacob Ladder format was mocked up, and proofs were tested. We printed and hand-scored to fold into the publications' accordion format. Ultimately, <i>FEED</i> was 145" long with totalled 34 pages of content between the front and back.</p>
