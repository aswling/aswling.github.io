	<h2><i>The Literacy Review</i> Volume 16</h2>
	<h3>Skills: Book design, art direction, print design, graphic design</h3>
	<h3>Tools: InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop</h3>

	<p><a href="https://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate/writing/literacyproject.html"><i>The Literacy Review</i></a> is an annual publication of writing from students in English as Second Other Language (ESOL) programs across New York City. Working alongside the editorial team and the journal's supervisors, I was responsible for the art direction and design of <i>LR</i>'s 16th volume. <i>The Literacy Review</i> Volume 16 was published by the Gallatin School of Individualized Study in May 2018.</p>
	<p>The creative direction for this year's <i>LR</i> drew inspiration from the nuances of English. All of the design assets are handwritten or derive graphic elements from type. However, beyond the obvious connection with language by creating graphics with text, these assets are also visually diverse. The cover and section dividers are all visually distinct, representing the multitude of experiences of the contributors, who each have their own complex feelings on learning English and, for many contributors, immigrating the United States. There are pieces that weave tales of excitingly vivid fiction, pieces that describe the writer's experience learning English, and pieces that reflect on the writer's complicated relationship with leaving their hometown to come to a new country. The 16th volume of <i>The Literacy Review</i> seeks to highlight the diversity of its contributors' stories and emphasize the plurality of experiences associated with literacy.</p>

	<h3>Process</h3>
	<p>I met regularly with the editorial team to pitch creative directions and present design proposals. The following are a few initial cover ideas and mood boards from when I was proposing potential concepts to the team.</p>
