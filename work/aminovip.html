	<h2>Amino VIP Branding</h2>
	<h3>Skills: Graphic design, branding, illustration</h3>
	<h3>Tools: Illustrator, Photoshop</h3>
	<p>As Design Intern at Amino, I assisted the Community teams with the design for the Amino VIP community. While “VIP” sounds exclusive, the Community teams wanted to make clear that Amino VIP was completely inclusive. Although made for active leaders making waves in their respective Amino, VIP is no secret and serves as an incentive for leaders to be more proactive in their roles. The VIP Amino is a space for awesome community leaders to interact and share ideas. Thus, the purpose of the design for Amino VIP was to create a refined but approachable visual style.</p>

	<p>After making several thematic boards featuring various styles, the Community teams preferred a minimal aesthetic with limited colors and simple shapes.</p>

	<p>I initially considered making organic and abstract shapes, but since the team wanted a more polished look, we decided to go with basic shapes derived from the letters in “VIP.” I paired this with the pink, yellow, blue, and navy swatches we use in other company materials. Although these components seem simple, the shapes and colors can be combined in infinite ways which complement the esteemed but fun character of Amino VIP.</p>
	<p>The following are the "Amino VIP" logo, icons that come in 16 varieties using the set color combinations, and backgrounds that can implement the different shapes.</p>
