	<h2>Amino Instagram Redesign</h2>
	<h3>Skills: Social media design, branding, illustration</h3>
	<h3>Tools: Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop</h3>

	<p>As Design Intern at Amino, I assisted the Community and Strategy teams with revamping Amino’s social media visual program. One of my first long-term projects at Amino was creating a cohesive image for Amino’s social media platforms. Amino was already very popular on Instagram, but this loyal following was not as massive on Facebook and Twitter. In order to unify its Instagram posts while adapting the company image to other platforms, the Community and Strategy teams wanted to create a distinct social media brand.</p>

	<h3>Process</h3>
	<p>The teams suggested I look at competing companies with quirky and fun social media presences, such as Tumblr, Twitter, and Reddit. Since Amino is known for bringing together a diversity of interests and fandoms, I proposed three possible directions and sketches for the revamp that emphasized repeating patterns and fun color schemes. The majority of Amino’s posts come from different Amino communities, so we wanted to ensure the graphics would not detract from showcasing the content, but could also stand out on their own for special social announcements. Thus, I created a pattern and defined a set of colors which can be applied to image posts, text posts, “emoji stories,” and customized posts like animations and special events.</p>
