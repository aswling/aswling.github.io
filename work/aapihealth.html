	<p>Semester-long ecological project for Digital Media Theory and Practice at NYU in Fall 2017. Special thanks to Wai Yee Chan of the <a href="https://cpc-nyc.org/">Chinese-American Planning Council</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/spikenlilli">Professor Jamie Bianco</a>.

	<p>In the United States, 5.6% of the population identifes as Asian or Asian-American. That means there are 17 million Asian-American Pacific Islanders in the United States. In 2016, the US Census reported 92.7% of Asians were covered by some form of health insurance, suggesting Asians were the second-most likely demographic to be insured. While this seems like a positive sign for wellness in AAPI communities, the census overlooks the cultural an physiological differences across Asian subgroups. Not only is there the overgeneralization of grouping hundreds of nationalities into a singular "Asian" category, but it does not take into account the wide range of factors that may prevent AAPI from disclosing health information (e.g. immigrant status, cultural stigma, language barrier). Assuming that all AAPI communities are well-off and healthy makes it difficult to understand and combat the problems facing different Asian subgroups.</p>
	<p>My project involved on-the-ground research about local AAPI organizations who engage AAPI communities in a culturally compotent way that allows them to effectively help residents access the health services they need. I worked closely with the Chinese-American Planning Council (CPC) in Flushing, where I had the chance to take photos of some of CPC's events and speak with Wai Yee Chan, the Director of the CPC Queens, about her thoughts regarding health stigmas and the importance of local organizations in reaching out to minority communities.</p>
